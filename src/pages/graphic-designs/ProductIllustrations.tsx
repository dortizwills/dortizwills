            As Shopmonkey prepared for Series C funding, they needed to refine their brand to reflect their growth from a startup to an industry leader. A key component was developing a cohesive illustration system that could explain complex software features to non-technical automotive professionals.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Leadership wanted illustrations that maintained Shopmonkey's approachable character while conveying greater sophistication and reliability. The illustrations needed to work across product, marketing, sales, and onboarding shops communications with a consistent style.

            I created a flexible illustration system with clear guidelines for style, color usage, and composition. The system focused on simplifying complex concepts through metaphor rather than literal representation, making software features more intuitive.
         </p>
          
         <p className="mb-6">
            We developed a set of diverse character illustrations representing shop owners, technicians, and customers. These characters maintained consistent proportions and style while reflecting the diversity of Shopmonkey's user base.

          <p className="mb-6">
            For more complex features, we created technical illustrations that combined simplified diagrams with our character system. These showed users interacting with the software in context, making abstract concepts more concrete.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            The illustration system was implemented across the product interface at key moments in the user journey, particularly during onboarding and feature introduction. Engineers received a dedicated component library to ensure consistent implementation.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            The illustration system extended to marketing materials, creating a cohesive visual experience from initial awareness through product usage. This strengthened brand recognition and reinforced key messages across all touchpoints.
