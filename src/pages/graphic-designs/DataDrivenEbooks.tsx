          Shopmonkey's core audience is composed of small to midsized automotive repair shops. In an attempt to entice additional customers and to retain current shops, Shopmonkey desired to produce data that shops could use to propel their businesses based on the prior year's data. I was responsible for reducing 40-60 pages of content into concise 15-25 page documents so that shops could retain the information and have actionable steps once completing the ebooks.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            This project required a consistent visual style with Shopmonkey's marketing materials and their product. I created a visual style guide composed of illustrations, brand elements, product screenshots, and customer photography to create consistency between ebooks and product. We were then able to pass the style guide to other graphic designers on the team for future ebooks on any subject.

            In 2020 Automotive shops were unsure as how their profits could withstand the effects of the pandemic. I used updated photography, new layouts, and illustrations to catalog shops that achieved positive results in the midst of hard times.
