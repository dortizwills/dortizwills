                I did some quick iterations and presented them internally to my managers. After 2 rounds of internal presentations the designs were refined and aligned to match our client's goals, this took just under 2 weeks to produce.

                  After rushing these designs over, the Adhere+ team consulted their C-Suite and deliberated for 4 weeks to ensure all their comments were up to date before our final design corrections and development could begin. <br></br> The main adjustment we had was on the About Us page. I adjusted the final designs based on their comments and made a handoff to our developers, where some additional compromises were made to aid a junior developer deliver the product on time.
