            When shops cut down on their service times by 15-30 minutes that benefits everyone. This app focuses on reducing the initial checkout time, providing truly quick services, and enabling staff to expedite each and every order.

            I agreed, and although he wouldn't see these, I wanted to spend some time iterating so that when I presented he could see the benefits of my deeper exploration. I captured a few of them below.

            The first design I presented was a chrome extension that would be persistent on any tire page, or could be toggled on/off when the user was done.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            My rationale was these options required less coding in Shopmonkey's primary application but they would directly sync tires to a shop's inventory, and enable users to add any inventory items to their shop.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            My second design was a cobranded tires landing page. Here users could have all their current tire vendors synced into a CoBranded page with Shopmonkey.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            After I presented both concepts we decided to pursue one of the chrome extensions. I developed the first concept into a simple prototype where users could add inventory in a few clicks.

            After showcasing these two designs my manager had an idea spark. The quick nature of these concepts could be directly applied to another product undergoing research – Express Lane. My concepts, if utilized correctly, could expand the services from the quick-lube subset of shops to any shop with quick services, especially when servicing tires, battery replacements, filter changes, windows, etc.
