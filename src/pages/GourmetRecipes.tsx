            I was first introduced to Blue Apron when a relative of mine ordered a pre-made meal plan. I have a number of friends and I myself have dietary restrictions, and I stumbled across their app when I was wanting to try a new recipe.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            After some time interacting with the app, I had a few misgivings that I was eager to solve because I saw the value of their recipes. I analyzed Blue Apron's on iOS and tried to understand their unique selling position. I listed pain points depending on users' needs. I then conducted a competitive analysis to find out how some competitors are addressing the same issues.

            I developed a user-persona for the specific user I wanted to target – the busy working class. I took care to document their frustrations and pain points and I made sure to include potential solutions for those pain points. I use personas because they're effective at understanding the broader audience of potential users, especially if researched properly.

            I used 2 low fidelity paths for these concepts and asked a few users to test and describe what they appreciated most out of each path. The first, in the new lower nav would allow users to add filters or search freely. The second would guide users in a more structured path where they only make small decisions at a time.
          </p>

            In my two initial concepts I focused on adding a lower navigational button for "quick" services and altering the "upcoming" section to a "delivery" tab.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3">
            The rationale was this new feature should be easily discovered when users needed to discover it under stress. My interviews instead revealed that a delivery option is so opposite of why users came to the app that I had to scrap it as a surfaced feature.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            I still saw the value in a delivery option so would attempt to weave it into the userflow at a later, noncritical point.

            For this stage I wanted to test a smart search feature against early filtering. I also included delivery within the primary user path, forcing users to decide if they wanted to deliver ingredients to their home or not. That decision led to a noticeable amount of frustration.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            It soon became evident, I had focused on too many secondary features to the extent I found the results inconclusive on the features I was actually trying to test.

            My revised path would allow these tertiary features to be skipped so that the primary path was not inhibited by my desires to see a particular path succeed. Instead the users' preferred search method would now inform which method of finding a unique recipe.

            I surveyed users at the beginning and conclusion of my project about their willingness to use Blue Apron's services. By adding this feature prior and new users expressed a 30% increase in their likelihood to use the service.

            I understand that when monetary commitment is involved, it changes the actual likelihood by about half, but a realistic 15% increase in users is still an enticing prospect for a company as large as Blue Apron.

            At the start, I knew I'd wanted delivery to be a key feature of these app additions. I tried to sway users into believing that it could be something they use without actually considering if they actually wanted to use it. After listening to customers I found they were pro delivery, just not as a primary function of the app. The key reminder here was to address the user needs first and afterwards to add delightful features.
