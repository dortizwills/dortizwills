            In mid 2023 my brother asked for some advice for his first camping trip. He'd never been before and between all the supply lists, internet articles, and recommendations from other friends he didn't know where to start.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            I've been on dozens of camping trips, led outdoor adventures, and gave expert advice at REI for years. Without guides like myself, most aspiring campers tend to give up after their first camping trip because it was too rough physically, expensive, or delivered an unexpected experience.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            I held these insights in mind as I focused on bridging the knowledge gap between inexperienced campers and their desire to camp. With so many options in the outdoors for camping there really is an experience for everyone, all we have to do is connect the proper dots.

            From my time at REI, the customers that needed the most help were one of the two categories.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            First, someone who wanted to go outside after or near retirement. It was very common for these customers to want as much advice over even the smallest decisions so they could comfortably purchase an item knowing it would last beyond the trips and into daily life.

          <p className="mb-6">
            Second, individuals who had seen picturesque locations from social media and wanted to visit those locations themselves. These individuals were younger and eager to take the first piece of advice as justification for their next decision. "I thought so" and "couldn't I just do this instead" were some of their most common phrases.

            In my initial corrections, I decided to use some low fidelity prototypes to take users through a guided process instead of placing them immediately into the app. This made them feel more in control of their camping decisions, but they still had too many decisions to make upfront – so I added a skip option to investigate further on the app.

            I changed the activity users started on so the base activity was more clear and simple.
            Initially I set up users with Backpacking, a more complicated version of camping – Now they would start simply with camping. I began adding fidelity for users to understand new information and additional options.

            By offering booking experiences for both seasoned and novice campers Camp Buddy received positive reviews following my user research group. Over half of interviewed users expressed interest in renting gear with an option to buy, especially if they used the same gear over multiple campsite trips.

            At the start, I knew I'd need to engage every type of user to be successful. My work ensures that regardless of income, experience levels, age, or diversity campers can forgo their reservations and enjoy the outdoors. After conducting interviews I found this was the only time my users had even considered camping and I was credited with bringing a new level of access to camping for them.
